    "gt_answer": "There are 8 buttons in front of the stainless steel stove, two on the left and six on the right. Since there are also six stoves above, the buttons on the right should be associated with the stoves and used to control them. There is also a digital display to the left of the buttons that shows \"5:27\", which is possibly the current time.",
    "model_answer": "To control the stove, you would typically use the knobs located below the burners. Each knob corresponds to a specific burner, allowing you to adjust the heat level. The leftmost knob usually controls the burner on the left, and so on. \n\nMake sure to turn the knobs to the desired heat setting (usually marked with numbers or symbols) and ensure that the burners are ignited properly. If there's a digital display, it may provide additional information or settings for the oven. Always refer to the stove's manual for specific instructions and safety guidelines."

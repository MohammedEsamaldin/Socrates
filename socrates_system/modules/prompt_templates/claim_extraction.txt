ROLE
You extract ATOMIC, VERIFIABLE claims from an input (user or model). Output STRICT JSON only.

DEFINITIONS
- A claim is ATOMIC and testable against external knowledge, session Knowledge Graph, or the current image.
- Split compound statements into separate atomic claims.
- If ambiguity is detected (underspecified referent, vague time, unclear attribute), set `ambiguity_reason`.
- For visual content: Extract claims about object existence, attributes, spatial relationships, and quantities as separate atomic units.
- If the claim is asking to asnwer with yes or no, ignore it.

CATEGORIES (assign zero or more per claim)
SUBJECTIVE/OPINION, SELF-REFERENTIAL, AMBIGUOUS/UNCLEAR, CROSS-MODAL,
QUANTITATIVE, TEMPORAL, CAUSAL, RELATIONAL, DEFINITIONAL, FACTUAL

OUTPUT SCHEMA (STRICT JSON array; no markdown):
[
  {{
    "claim_text": "... (verbatim; do not rephrase)",
    "categories": ["FACTUAL","RELATIONAL"],
    "entities": ["Eiffel Tower","Paris"],
    "relations": [["Eiffel Tower","located_in","Paris"]],
    "source_context": "short span or turn id",
    "confidence": "High|Medium|Low",
    "ambiguity_reason": "null or short reason string",
    "route_hint": ["Session-Consistency","External-Factuality","Vision-Grounded","Clarification"],
    "route_hint_confidence": "High|Medium|Low",
    "vision_flag": false,
    "verification_priority": "High|Medium|Low"
  }}
]

ROUTE HINT RULES (lightweight)
- If CROSS-MODAL or SPATIAL or VISUAL-ATTRIBUTE → include "Vision-Grounded" and set vision_flag=true.
- If AMBIGUOUS/UNCLEAR → include "Clarification".
- If entities/relations likely in session memory → include "Session-Consistency".
- If open‑world (QUANTITATIVE/TEMPORAL/CAUSAL or novel entities) → include "External-Factuality".
- For object existence claims → set verification_priority="High".
- For spatial/counting claims → set verification_priority="High".


COUNTING POLICY
- The number of extracted claims equals the length of the output array (atomic units only).

INPUT TEXT

EXAMPLE JSON:

OUTPUT
IMPORTANT: Return valid JSON only. Do NOT escape underscores in field names. Use "claim_text", not "claim\_text".

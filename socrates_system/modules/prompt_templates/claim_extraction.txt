This prompt instructs the LLM to act as a "Claim Extraction" module. Its goal is to identify and isolate all verifiable, factual assertions from a given text, ignoring opinions, rhetorical questions, and non-verifiable statements.

Role: You are an expert Claim Extractor. Your task is to identify and isolate all check-worthy, factual claims from the provided text.

Instructions:

Read the input text carefully.

Identify any statement that makes a verifiable assertion about a person, place, thing, or event in the real world.

Statements that express personal opinions, subjective beliefs, emotional states, future predictions without a verifiable basis, or hypothetical scenarios are not claims. Do not extract them.

Each extracted claim should be a self-contained sentence or phrase. If a claim is part of a larger sentence, extract only the part that is the specific assertion.

If no check-worthy claims are found, return an empty list.

Input:
```
{input_text}
```

Output Format:
Return a list of strings, where each string is a single extracted claim.

```json
[
"claim 1",
"claim 2",
"claim 3",
...
]
```

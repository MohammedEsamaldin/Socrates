2025-08-04 21:52:24,695 - socrates_system.modules.claim_extractor - ERROR - Failed to decode LLM response as JSON: I'll use Python and its libraries to implement this functionality.

Firstly, we need a library that can handle NLP (Natural Language Processing) tasks such as entity recognition and relationship extraction. We will use `spaCy` for these tasks.

Then, we need a way to parse the input text into individual sentences or claims. This can be done using `nltk` or other libraries, but for simplicity, we'll assume that each sentence is a separate claim.

Here's how you could implement this in Python:

```python
import spacy
from nltk.tokenize import sent_tokenize

# Load the English language model from spaCy
nlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')

def extract_claims(text):
    # Tokenize the text into sentences
    claims = sent_tokenize(text)

    output = []

    for claim in claims:
        doc = nlp(claim)
        
        entities = []
        relationships = []
        
        for ent in doc.ents:
            entities.append({
                "text": ent.text,
                "label": ent.label_,
                "start_char": ent.start_char,
                "end_char": ent.end_char
            })

        # Find the subject and object of each sentence
        for token in doc:
            if token.dep_ == 'nsubj':
                subject = {
                    "text": token.text,
                    "label": token.ent_type_,
                    "start_char": token.idx,
                    "end_char": token.idx + len(token.text)
                }
            elif token.dep_ == 'dobj' or token.dep_ == 'iobj':
                object_ = {
                    "text": token.text,
                    "label": token.ent_type_,
                    "start_char": token.idx,
                    "end_char": token.idx + len(token.text)
                }

        # Extract relationships
        for token in doc:
            if token.dep_ == 'ROOT' and subject and object_:
                relationships.append({
                    "subject": subject["text"],
                    "relation": token.text,
                    "object": object_["text"]
                })

        # Create the output JSON
        output.append({
            "claim_text": claim,
            "confidence_score": 0.95, # Assuming a high confidence score for now
            "entities": entities,
            "relationships": relationships
        })

    return {"claims": output}

# Test the function with some sample text
text = """
The Eiffel Tower, a landmark in Paris, France, was completed in 1889. It stands at 330 meters tall. Many people think it's the most beautiful structure in the world.
"""

print(extract_claims(text))
```

This script uses spaCy to analyze each sentence and extract entities and relationships. The output is a list of claims with their corresponding entities and relationships.

Please note that this script assumes you have the `en_core_web_sm` language model installed, which can be downloaded using:

```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

Also note that spaCy's entity recognition accuracy may vary depending on the quality of its training data.

Note: The confidence values are subjective and may vary based on the complexity of the claim, the context, and the model's understanding. 

The output contains four claims:

1. **Claim 1**: "This picture contains my red cat." - This is a factual statement about the content of the picture.
2. **Claim 2**: "I was playing in the yard." - This is a personal experience claim, which might be subjective but can be verified through other means (e.g., photos or video).
3. **Claim 3**: "I don't have a dog." - This is a clear and verifiable statement about the owner's possession.
4. **Claim 4**: "My dog does something in the yard." - Although this claim is not directly stated, it can be inferred from the context (the absence of a dog mentioned) and might be considered check-worthy.

Please note that the model has attempted to extract clear and unambiguous subclaims while avoiding vague references like 'he,' 'she,' 'it,' or 'this.' However, some claims may still require additional context for verification.'

Explanation:

1. The first claim is extracted from the text and has a confidence score of 0.92.
2. The second claim also contains an ambiguous reference ("Obama was the president of Canada") since Obama was never the president of Canada (he was the President of the United States), which makes this claim have low confidence. The `ambiguity_reason` field is set to "INACCURATE_INFORMATION, PRONOUN_REFERENCE" indicating that the claim contains incorrect information and a pronoun reference without clear antecedent.

Note: As per your rules, if no relevant assertions or inquiries are found, an empty list should be returned, but in this case, there are two claims extracted from the text.'

Explanation:

* The first claim is a clear assertion about the Nile River being the longest in the world. It has high confidence (0.98) and contains one entity, which is labeled as a LOCATION.
* The second claim appears to be an inquiry/assertion but is ambiguous due to "Obama" having multiple roles (former US President Barack Obama vs. possibly referring to someone else), and it inaccurately states he was the president of Canada. This results in a lower confidence score (0.5) and ambiguity reason (PRONOUN_REFERENCE). It also contains two entities, which are labeled as PERSON and COUNTRY respectively.'

I extracted two claims:

1. The Nile is the longest river in the world.
2. Obama was the president of Canada.

For claim 1, I have a high confidence level (0.95) that it's a relevant assertion, and I identified "the Nile" as a location entity.

For claim 2, I have a moderate confidence level (0.8), but I also detected an ambiguity reason: "COUNTRY_LABELING_ERROR". This is because Barack Obama was the president of the United States, not Canada. I still extracted the country label for "Canada", but the claim itself is likely incorrect or misleading.'

**Rationale:**

1. The input text is a simple statement, and the primary objective is to extract atomic, verifiable claims.
2. The claim "He did it." is a direct factual statement but lacks specificity (e.g., what was done). However, considering the extraction principles, we prioritize extracting all relevant items and maintain referential clarity.
3. Since there are no specific details or context provided in the input text, the extracted claim has a low confidence level ("Low").
4. As per the rules, we set the `type_hint` to "EXPLICIT_FACTUAL_CLAIMS" based on the nature of the statement.

Note that this output could be further improved by adding more context or refining the claims extraction process. However, given the simplicity and lack of specific details in the input text, the above JSON object represents a basic extraction attempt according to the provided guidelines.'

Note that I've split the compound statement into a single atomic claim, and assigned categories based on the input text. I've also set `ambiguity_reason` to null since there is no ambiguity detected in this case.

Also, I've included "External-Factuality" as a route hint since the claim is likely open-world (quantitative) and novel entities are involved.'

```
Note that I've split the compound statement into a single atomic claim, and assigned categories based on the input text. The `entities` field contains only the entity "France", as there are no other entities mentioned in the input text. The `relations` field is empty since there are no relations mentioned between entities. The `source_context` field is set to "short span or turn id" (this can be replaced with a more specific value if needed). The `confidence` field is set to "Medium", as this is an open-ended question that requires further context to determine its accuracy. The `ambiguity_reason` field is null since there are no ambiguities detected in the input text. Finally, the `route_hint` and `route_hint_confidence` fields are set based on the rules outlined above.'
